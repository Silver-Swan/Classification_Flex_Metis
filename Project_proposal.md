# Using Classification Techniques on Neuromuscluar-Blocking Drugs (NMDs) data set 

## Question/Need
Neuromuscluar-Blocking Drugs are used on patients by anesthesiologists to paralyze the skeletal muscle fibers and so impending (in)voluntary muscular contractions. This molecular effect translates into a multitude of both surgical and anesthetic benefits. It facilitates airway manipulattions such as endotracheal intubation, eases protective lung ventilation strategies and enhance surgical conditions. Since NMDs paralyze both primary and secondary breathing muscles, the close monitoring of their clinical effect is paramount in order to assure that patients are only allowed to awake from anesthesia when their muscluar breathing capacity is deemed acceptiable by international anesthetic standards. Not doing so has the potential to significantly increase post-operative pulmonary complications, as well as its accompanying healthcare cost. Unfortunately, the incidence of residual neuromuscular block is still high and estimated at 20-40%. The effective reduction of such high rates is still in the early stages, as residual neuromuscular block is responsible for an increase incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications.  
## Data Discription
The data gathered was from ![](). This data set has 21,891 data points with 23 features or attributes. This data set will be used to build a ilustrative model to help anesthesiologists with analyzing patients.    
## Tools
- Python to create a machine learning program. Using sklearn and classification to build useful models. 
- Seaborn and matplotlib for visualization and graphs. 
- Pandas to create a dataframe.
## MVP Goal
- Provide a baseline model.
- Have a kNN dicision region graph to determine which features would be best used.
- With added complexity, it will show that the model will allow for accuracy.
