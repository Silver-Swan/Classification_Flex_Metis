# Using Classification Techniques on Neuromuscluar-Blocking Drugs (NMDs) data set 

## Question/Need

## Data Discription

## Tools
- Python to create a machine learning program. Using sklearn and classification to build useful models. 
- Seaborn and matplotlib for visualization and graphs. 
- Pandas to create a dataframe.
## MVP Goal
- Provide a baseline model.
- Have a kNN dicision region graph to determine which features would be best used.
- With added complexity, it will show that the model will allow for accuracy.
